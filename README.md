# React Counter with Redux Toolkit
This React Counter App is a simple demonstration of state management using Redux ToolKit. It features a set of buttons that allow users to interact with the counter. The app utilizes the react-redux and reduxtoolkit libraries to manage its state.

# Key Features
__Increment__: Increases the count by 1.

__Decrement__: Decreases the count by 1.

__Increase by 10__: Adds 10 to the count.

__Toggle Counter__: Toggles the counter visibility

In addition to the counter functionality, this app includes an authentication component. Users can log in, and upon authentication, they gain access to additional features, including:

**My Products**: View your products. (dummy nav link)

**My Sales**: Access your sales data. (dummy nav link)

**Logout**: Log out from the application.

This app serves as a practical example of how to integrate Redux Toolkit for state management and implement client side user authentication in your React application. It's a valuable resource for developers looking to learn or showcase Redux Toolkit and client side authentication techniques.
